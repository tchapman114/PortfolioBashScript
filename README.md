# Portfolio Bash Script
This was a fun portfolio Bash Script assignment I did for my internship! 
The purpose of this project was to practice my bash scripting skills and become more familiar with Linux Bash commands. It demostrates the usage of bash scripting varibles, conditional statements, and loops.

# To run bash script:
1. Download file in wanted directory
2. In the terminal, enter bash portfolio_bash_script.sh or ./portfolio_bash_script.sh

# How it should function:
1. Ask user for input
2. Display number of personal facts to user, based on their previous input
3. Ask user if they would like my contact information
4. End
